A GuerillaTags editor for maya i made, my purpose is to make it the most comfortable possible

## Introduction 
    
    This is a script I created for Autodesk Maya, its purpose is to generate GuerillaTags for GuerillaRender workflow
    my purpose is to make it the most comfortable possible. Feedbacks for improvements are welcomes.
    I will upgrade it on  my spare time.


## How to install ?

    This is a script with multiples sub-modules : you have to install it inside any of Maya's script path
    (e.g. "D:\Users\<Username>\Documents\maya\<20xx>\scripts")
    - Create a folder `gtag_editor` inside the script folder ;
    - Copy this repo content inside `gtag_editor`;


## Todo list 
    - Refactoring all the code to make it clearer ;
    - Adding the possibility to add all the tags from selection to the last selected ;
