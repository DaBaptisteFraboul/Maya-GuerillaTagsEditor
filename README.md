# Maya-GuerillaTagsEditor

## Introduction 
This is a script I created for Autodesk Maya, its purpose is to generate GuerillaTags for GuerillaRender workflow
my purpose is to make it the most comfortable possible. Feedbacks for improvements are welcomes.
I will upgrade it on  my spare time.


## How to install ?
This is a script with multiples sub-modules : you have to install it inside any of Maya's script path.

(e.g. "D:\Users\<Username>\Documents\maya\<20xx>\scripts")
- Create a folder `gtag_editor` inside the script folder ;
- Copy this repo content inside `gtag_editor`;
- Inside Maya, execute the script main.py from `gtag_editor`(create a shelf shortcut for convenience).
