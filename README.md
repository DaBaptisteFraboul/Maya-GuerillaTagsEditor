# Maya-GuerillaTagsEditor
A GuerillaTags editor for maya i made, my purpose is to make it the most comfortable possible


## Todo list 

    - Refactoring all the code to make it clearer
    - Adding the options to switch beetwen : 
        - Selection : all objects/selection/selection and children [get the tags]
        - Affectation :  all objects/selection/selection and children [set the tags]
    - Create an interactive mode : Tags come from selection but the tags are added to last selected object
    - Adding the possibility to add all the tags from selection to the last selected
